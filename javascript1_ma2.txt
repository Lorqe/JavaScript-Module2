1. What is a function literal?
A function literal is an unnamed function. No function name is required.

The constructor is for example a "blueprint" for an object. Where you write the object with all of its properties.
Thereafter you can create "new" objects with the same blueprint.

The return statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function.



4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		

function myFunction(){
			 
 return console.log('inside my function');

5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.
Scope in JavaScript is where we can access variables. You have Global and Local scope.
Local scope is variables inside function where only that function can access the varibale.
Global scope is variables outside of functions where all functions can access the variable.
